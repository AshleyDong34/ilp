## ILP Project - Pizza Drone Delivery service

Introduction: This project was about order validation and pathfinding a route for a drone delivery service to deliver pizza from local restuarants to the top of Appleton tower. The project follows the project specification provided to us in the Informatics Large Pratical course.

Our implementation uses the greedy algorithm to create a viable path for the drone, and also takes the exact same path back for consistency. We also sort the order locations for the restuarants in order of the shortest distance, to maximise the number of deliveries we can make.

The files provided:

* All the classes used for running this project is included in the src file, then navigate to the java file, and all classes are in that file.
* Unit tests for the project are in the test file under the src file
* Resulting files of 12 different sample days in GEOJson and Json containing the order delivery information and drone flightpath is under the resultfiles file.
* Supporting documents for software testing is located in the the SoftwareTestingDocs
* Report detailing the arcitecture of the project and the reasons for the decisions made regarding the project
* There is a .jar file that you can run to test the project under the target file.
